# E-commerce Summer Sales: How well a product is likely to sell using ML.

### Overview:
In this study, I extracted 10 significant features out of 43 provided in the dataset and trained a Linear Regression model that predicts "units_sold" of products. 

**Evaluation Metrics used:** Mean absolute error and R-Squared


### Findings:

It is observed that out of the 10 features, products marked rating 3 and 5 have a significant positive impact on sales, followed by merchants who used ad boosts, their total rating count, discount percent on the product, with a retail price of the product having a significant negative impact.

**Sales Estimator Equation:**

**units_sold** = *(uses_ad_boosts x 642.80) + (rating_three_count x 15.06) + (rating_five_count x 3.33) +
                 (merchant_rating_count x 0.003) + (product_id x -0.850) + (discount x -1.73) +
                 (discount_percent x -6.038) + (product_variation_size_id x -10.65) +
                 (retail_price x -16.418) + (badge_fast_shipping x -3173.258)*


*Note: Weights for each feature are absolute weights, may differ from relative weights obtained by transforming features to a common scale, which is depicted in the plot below*
